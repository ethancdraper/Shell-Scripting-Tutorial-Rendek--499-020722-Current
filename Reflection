Rendek Shell Scripting Reflection Pt. 1
I was working on this after an excruciating day of readings (perhaps mistake number one). Nevertheless, I thought it would be easy enough to follow along a tutorial since this one should have been clearer to follow than the last one (now that I know what a terminal is). Unfortunately, that was not the case. I do not find this intuitive at all, and it just seemed like I was running into error after error without knowing how to move forward. I could definitely feel myself getting frustrated, so I decided to put it down and I will try again from the start tomorrow. 

Rendek Shell Scripting Reflection Pt. 2
I'm currently having the same issue as last night, but I have peanut butter cookies in the oven so it's not as frustrating. I also put it into 'Homebrew' view which makes it better. I reached out to my coworker from the summer (computer science student Ethan Heavey who is supervised by Dr. James Hughes) and tried what he recommended but I could not get it to work. I think that because this is so brand new to me, I would benefit from doing the tutorials during lab time so that I can readily ask questions. While I was not able to get it to do what I wanted it to, I haven’t been too discouraged nor have I been put off from learning it. Though I am a little embarrassed that I couldn’t get past ‘What Is Scripting’, I’m reminding myself that this is a brand new skill and like any other it will take me time to learn and I shouldn’t have anything to be embarrassed about because everyone has to start somewhere.
